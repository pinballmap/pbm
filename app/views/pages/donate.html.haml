      %span.darkb Since 2007,
      we've spent countless evenings and weekends building, maintaining, and enhancing Pinball Map. It's a fun project, and we're grateful that so many people find it useful. We're committed to continuing to improve the site.
    %p But as the site has grown in popularity and scope, the infrastructure costs have also grown. They are pretty modest, but they still take a bite out of our wallets.
    %p To help us defray these costs, we made the decision to ask for donations. We've never made money off of this site, and we want it to remain ad-free.
    %p Here are the costs, and thus our annual donation goals:
    %ul.list
      %li $110/year - Dreamhost
      %li $20/year - Domain
      %li $192/year - Database + SSL Encryption
      %li $100/year - Apple Developer Fee
      %li.darkb GRAND TOTAL: $422
    %p If you like Pinball Map and want to help support it, you have our heartfelt thanks!
