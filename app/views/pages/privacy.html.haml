		%p.question Users
		%p In Winter 2016, we added a user system. In this system, people create user accounts. Only logged in users can take the actions listed above. So now those emails contain user info (username and email address). We have a log of edits made to the site, and we can use that log to make sure certain users aren't messing with things.
		%p.question Additional

		%p.question We do not share:
