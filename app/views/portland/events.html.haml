      %span There are plenty of non-tournament events going on. One notable one is the monthly ladies league. If you are a lady, and you like pinball, this event is an opportunity to meet up and make friends and stuff!

      %p.pink If you have a pinball event that you'd like included on this page, use the contact form on the
