      Hi, welcome to 
      %span.yellow pinballmachine.org! 
      This site lists all the pinball machines in the 
      %span.yellow Bay Area (San Francisco)
      region. This data is kept up to date by YOU (and you and you, too). So please use the features on the site to add/remove machines from locations, and to add new locations to the map. You can also add photos of the locations, so that people can get a better idea of what the place is like.
